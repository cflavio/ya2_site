Hi! We've released a *new version* of **Yorg**!

When we planned this release we thought that it would have been a "light" release, but we got a lot of suggestions and several contributions (yeah, people are helping us! \o/ ), so it has become **a rich release**!

First of all, we've released **a new track** (with its original song!): *Rome*. Here's an instant of a race in the new track:

Now you can drive on **5** tracks! Moreover, we've added **a new car**, *Teia*:

Now you can select among **8** cars!

The main feature of the 0.8 release is **seasons**. Before this release, you could do only single races: you selected a track, a car, a driver, did that race, and that was it. Now, you can do an entire season! You race on every track (so, 5 races), and there is a ranking that is maintained between the races. So, in the end, you must drive carefully to collect your points in order to win the *championship*!!!

Moreover, we got some contributions. Specifically, we've **two new languages**: *deutsch* and *scottish gaelic*! A lot of thanks go to *Wuzzy* and *GunChleoc*!

Moreover, we got a lot of **feedbacks** on [FreeGameDev](http://forum.freegamedev.net) and Reddit. This leaded to several unplanned features (so, thanks go to them for their suggestions): we've improved *cars' audio*, we've refined our *driving model* and we've implemented a *graphical installer* for Linux.

Moreover, we've implemented other meaningful **features**: we've changed the *camera*, we've added the *drifting*, we've done several *AI* performance improvements and fixes, we've added several *sfx*, we've *decreased the download size*.

So, here is our new **release trailer**!
