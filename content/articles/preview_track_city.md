Hi! Our artist has released some renders of his last track!

As you can see, our next track will be a *city*.

So, this time you'll drive on asphalt, tight turns, no offroads...

Yes, there are also crossroads! You'll have to be careful, otherwise you may hit other cars!

We're working hard on next release, stay tuned!
