Hi! I have published a RC build some weeks ago. I have received some important feedbacks about bugs and *meaningful features* that I could implement quickly. Moreover, there has been a *new Panda3D release*. So, here is another RC build.

Changelog since last RC build:

* menu navigation with dpad;
* added gamepad's vibration;
* building with Panda3D 1.10.4.1;
* several menu fixes;
* fixed race's start (with gamepad).

Testing
=======

If you kindly test this build (this would help me *a lot*), please [report me]({filename}/pages/about.md) any bugs you observe. **Thank you very much**!


Download
========

You can find *0.11rc2*'s **download links** [here](http://www.ya2tech.it).


Screenshots
===========

Here are a couple of screenshots of the new version. Actually, I am reusing the ones of the previous post (sharing on social networks needs some images, you know).
