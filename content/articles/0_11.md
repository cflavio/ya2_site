Hi! I have released a *new version* of **Yorg**! Let's talk about the new features.

Local multiplayer
-----------------

I have implemented **local multiplayer**. Now, you can play with your friends on the same computer. This is implemented using split-screen.

Joypad support
--------------

Yorg is developed using the *latest* version of **Panda3D** (see later for details). This provides us a lot of intriguing features. The first one is the support for joypads. Now, you are not constrained to keyboards: you can use your favorite controllers. This is a new feature of Yorg (and Panda3D): if you observe any problems, please let me know.

Particle effects
----------------

Another awesome feature of the new Panda3D is the improved support for **shader-based particle effects**. I have implemented some particle effects (skidmarks, weapons, sparkles), but they are not definitive (actually some of them are pretty ugly tbh). I would love to improve them in the future, anyway here is a first implementation.

Online multiplayer's GUI
------------------------

I received some important constructive criticisms about the previous **online multiplayer's GUI**. So, I have revamped it: now it should be clearer. A lot of thanks go to *Gaming On Linux* for reporting my bad implementation!

Updated translations
--------------------

I have received several contributions. Specifically, I have updated these **translations**: *Scottish Gaelic*, *Spanish*, *Galician*, *French* and *Italian*! A lot of thanks go to *GunChleoc*, *Leandro* and *xin*!

Various improvements
--------------------

The iterative approach of Yorg's development implies that I can improve some aspects at each release. Panda3D's new version provided some huge **performance improvements**: I am sure that you will be very happy about their hard work. Then, I have changed some **sfx**. Moreover, I have fixed some bugs in the **AI** (it is not very good yet, let's improve that in a future release). Finally, I have tuned the **driving model**: I hope you will find driving more fun (anyway, I should still improve it in the future).

Panda3D 1.10 and Python 3
-------------------------

A lot of work has been allocated on keeping Yorg modern. **Panda3D 1.10** is an awesome release: they have implemented many important features (Setuptools-based deployment, huge performance improvements, gamepad support, better shader support, ...). I humbly try to use Panda3D the best I can. Moreover, I have ported the entire codebase to **Python 3**.


Online multiplayer's status
---------------------------

Please, consider the online multiplayer as **experimental**. It should work (there are no known bugs). But, when the server is overloaded (as instance, when it is building a new version of Yorg), Yorg's server process may be killed by Linux's OOM killer. Unfortunately, I can't buy more resources for the server, and I use it for several things (building pipeline, Yorg's game server, Yorg's related projects, ...). While I constantly hope to get more resources from our Patreon campaign to improve the situation, I should refactor the server code to get it lean (so, I can get the server more stable even with low resources).

Huge thanks
===========

*Huge thanks* go to **Leandro** for testing and for his competence. He gave me many suggestions for improving Yorg. If you find Yorg a bit better, it is thanks to him.

Other *huge thanks* go to the [supporters]({filename}/pages/support_us.md): I couldn't even face the basic costs of this project (hosting, VPS) without you. If you can still see any news from this project, it is because they are so generous.
