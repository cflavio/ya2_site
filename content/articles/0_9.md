First of all, we've released **a new track** (with its original song!): *Toronto*. This is a snowy track, so you will experience less adherence: you must be very careful! But, otoh, it is very fun to drift on the snow! Here's an instant of a race in the new track:

So, now you can drive on **6** tracks!

We've received some contributions. Specifically, we've **three new languages**: *Spanish*, *Galician* and *French*! A lot of thanks go to *Leandro* and *Xin*! Plus, *Scottish Gaelic* has been updated (thanks *GunChleoc*)!

We've received several feedbacks, and we've refined our **driving model** following them.

Moreover, we've added a bit of **bloom** to the graphics.

Finally, the most asked feature so far: we've added **experimental multiplayer support**! Here is a screenshot during a multiplayer race:

Notes about the multiplayer
===========================

We want to stress that the multiplayer support is **very experimental**. So, you may see crashes, and we apologize for that. We've tested it a lot using our machines, but there are a lot of scenarios out there that may not have been caught by our tests.

In order to play a multiplayer race, you need an **XMPP** account. There are a lot of services which provide free XMPP accounts. We suggest creating a **new** XMPP account for playing Yorg since our XMPP support is still experimental.

Please note that if you want to host a match then you need to **open the port 9099** of your router and your firewall ([here]({filename}/pages/port_check.md) is a guide for checking if your port is actually open).

**We're already working on this limitation (and many other improvements): this is an experimental feature and this is NOT the definitive implementation**.
