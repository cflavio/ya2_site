Hi! A fast update about my development efforts.

Roadmap to 0.11
---------------

Already implemented:

* local multiplayer;
* particle effects;
* joypad support;
* Python 3 porting;
* Panda3D 1.10 porting;
* reimplementation of the online multiplayer's gui;
* sfx improvements;
* AI improvements;
* performance improvements;
* driving model's improvements;
* new building pipeline on the VPS.

Remaining tasks:

* testing and bugfixing.

So, I've implemented everything that I planned for 0.11. Now, I'm testing and fixing the project.

Some download stats:

* total: 2700 downloads;
    * itch.io: 1592 downloads;
    * GameJolt: 760 downloads and 26 installations;
    * IndieDB: 322 downloads.

A **great** news is that we've reached the [second goal](https://www.patreon.com/ya2) on Patreon: the _VPS_. It is _awesome_ that you are helping us in maintaining the VPS! It's _very important_ since we're using it for providing online multiplayer and Yorg's builds. A lot of thanks go to the [patroners]({filename}/pages/support_us.md): this project wouldn't exist without you!

A couple of screenshots of the brand new feature: **local multiplayer**:
