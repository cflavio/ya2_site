Hi! After a lot of development, I have built a **release candidate** for Yorg's next version!

I will be more detailed about the new features in the release's post. Shortly, in the current build you will find:

* local multiplayer;
* joypad support;
* particle effects;
* reimplementation of the online multiplayer's gui;
* translation updates (Scottish Gaelic, Spanish, Galician, French);
* sfx improvements;
* AI improvements;
* performance improvements;
* driving model's improvements.

From a technical point of view, the new version is based on *Python 3* and *Panda3D 1.10*.
