Hi! Our artist has released *some renderings of his last track*!

<p align="center"><a href="{filename}/images/yorg/toronto1.jpg"><img src="{filename}/images/yorg/toronto1.jpg" width="660" height="371" /></a></p>

As you can see, our next track will be in a **snowy** land!

So, this time you must be *very* careful: car's adherence will be an issue for you!
