Title: Welcome to the new site
Date: 2017-10-9

Hi! Welcome to the new site! We hope you like it!

We had several issues with the previous one. It was WordPress-based, and after a lot of years there were some minor issues, but they were pretty annoying. Moreover, we wanted to implement a simpler approach, so now we're using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com).

**Note:** if you are following us, you may receive notifications for old posts (e.g. emails, social networks' posts, ...). This is expected since some publishing tools will detect the changes and interpret them as new posts. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for reading!
