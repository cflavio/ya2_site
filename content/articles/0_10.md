A new track, a new song
-----------------------

First of all, we've released **a new track** (with its **original song**!): *Sinus Aestuum* (it is on the *Moon*!). This track has several interesting aspects, like alternative paths, holes, ... Here's an instant of a race in the new track:

So, now you can drive on **7** tracks!

New camera
----------

We've received a feature request on Panda3D's forum by the users *sazearte* and *Uther*, who asked for a new **camera**. Now you can select a camera *from rear*, if you prefer. Here is a screenshot with the new camera:

Updated GUI
-----------

Moreover, as you can see in the previous screenshot, we've rearranged things in the **GUI**, following *Leandro*'s suggestions: thanks!

Multiplayer
-----------

A *huge* aspect is that we've changed our previous **multiplayer** implementation in order to improve players' experience.

* Previously, users needed to create XMPP accounts externally. Now, you can create your accounts *from inside the game*, with an *easy and fast process*.
* Moreover, now a player who wants to host a match doesn't need to configure its machine for accepting external traffic (i.e. *he doesn't need to open a port on the router* anymore).

So, now the multiplayer experience should be as simple as possible.

Driving model
-------------

We've received some feedback, and we've refined our **driving model** following it.

Updated translations
--------------------

We've received several contributions. Specifically, we've updated these **translations**: *Scottish Gaelic*, *Spanish*, *Galician*, *French* and *Italian*! A lot of thanks go to *GunChleoc*, *Leandro* and *xin*!

Trailer
