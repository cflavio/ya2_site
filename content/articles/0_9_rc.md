Hi! After a lot of development, we have built a **release candidate** for Yorg's next version!

We will be more detailed about the new features in release's post. Shortly, in the current build you will find: *a new track*, *a new song*, **experimental** *multiplayer support*, new languages (*spanish*, *galician*, *french*), updated languages (*scottish gaelic*), graphics improvements (*bloom*), some improvements to the driving model.

Here is a screenshot of the new track:

Notes about the multiplayer
===========================

We are announcing this release candidate since the multiplayer support is **very experimental**, and we would like to test it before publishing.

In order to play a multiplayer race, you need an *XMPP* account. There are a lot of services which provide free XMPP accounts. We suggest creating a **new** XMPP account for playing Yorg since our XMPP support is still experimental.

Please note that if you want to host a match then you need to **open the port 9099** of your router and your firewall ([here]({filename}/pages/port_check.md) is a guide for checking if your port is actually open).


**We're already working on this limitation (and many other improvements): this is an experimental feature and this is NOT the definitive implementation**.

Download
========

You can find *0.9rc1*'s **download links** in [Yorg's page]({filename}/pages/download.md), at the bottom.
