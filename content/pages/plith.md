**Plith** is a fresh indie puzzle game for *Windows*, *OSX* and *Linux*. It puts gamers in a spatial setting, where they have to manage several puzzle elements (mostly gears) and must make quick decisions which can simplify or complicate their path to victory.

Plith is a fast paced game which contains a lot of levels – more than 100 – to be solved. The player moves some gears and can place them on the level; some gears rotate, and transmit their rotation to the adjacent ones: the objective of each level is to activate the target gears. These levels constitute five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections. Each section introduces new gameplay elements; for example, several kinds of gears and obstacles come out along the game. The game is presented using mostly 3D graphics, with a few handmade drawings as well.

*"Plith also possesses a renewal in levels making the game even more interesting. [...] The graphic aspect of this game was beautifully done, the background is pretty, it contains nice animations and all items used in the gameplay are also nice. [...] Plith is an excellent puzzle game, a real brainstorming, which is very entertaining and even addictive! It is very difficult to resist its charm once you tried playing. I can only recommend you to promptly buy it (furthermore, it's not expensive, you really have no excuse)!"* (Arnauk, [Game Side Story](http://www.gamesidestory.com/2012/07/13/gametest-plith-pc-mac-linux))

*"The elements are simple to understand while you play, yet the complicated ways they work together are difficult to explain in writing. That’s often a sign of a great central mechanic: straight forward enough for players to pick up quickly, but deep enough to allow for many puzzle possibilities.

If you’re a fan of puzzle games, Plith is definitely worth the miniscule asking price of $3.99."* (Michael Irving, [Capsule Computers](http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2012/06/micks-indie-picks-plith))
