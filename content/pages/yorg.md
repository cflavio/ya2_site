Notes about the multiplayer
---------------------------

We want to stress that the multiplayer support is **very experimental**. So, you may see crashes, and we apologize for that. We've tested it a lot using our machines, but there are a lot of scenarios out there that may not have been caught by our tests.

In order to play a multiplayer race, you need an **XMPP** account. There are a lot of services which provide free XMPP accounts. We suggest creating a **new** XMPP account for playing Yorg since our XMPP support is still experimental.

Please note that if you want to host a match then you need to **open the port 9099** of your router and your firewall ([here]({filename}/pages/port_check.md) is a guide for checking if your port is actually open).

**We're already working on this limitation (and many other improvements): this is an experimental feature and this is NOT the definitive implementation**.

More info
---------

**Note:** disable shaders and reduce cars' number in order to play on slower machines.

**System requirements**: 2 GB RAM, 1 GB HD.

We apply **Continuous Delivery** in our development. This means that you can play a new build of the game as soon as we do anything. Look at [here](http://www.ya2tech.it/download.html) to pick a development/unstable build.

Yorg is developed by using several **tools**: [Panda 3D](http://www.panda3d.org), [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org).

The **development team** is currently composed of *Flavio Calva* and *Luca Quartero*. Moreover, *Jay Bachelor* is a precious collaborator (more info [here]({filename}/pages/about.md)).
