Mailing list
============

Maybe the easiest way to keep in touch with us is by using emails. We have a mailing list where developers and community members hang out. If you want to subscribe, send an empty email to <mailto:ya2_community-join@ya2.it>. You can easily unsubscribe when you want.

IRC channel
===========

If you prefer a chat, you can find developers and community members in the channel *#yorg* on *freenode.net*. If you don't have an IRC client, you can use their [web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=yorg). Please note that we can't always answer promptly: it may take hours to get an answer (but we answer always), please be patient! :)

Social networks
===============

If you prefer social networks, we are also there (links are in the side menu).
