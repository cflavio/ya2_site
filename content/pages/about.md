Hi, I'm **Flavio Calva**. I'm the founder of *Ya2*. I was born in Rome; at present I live in Rome. I have a degree in computer science. Videogames are my main passion (Football Manager and Civilization are my favourite ones). I love manga (Meitantei Konan is awesome). Moreover, I love detective stories (mostly Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle). I suck at cooking (despite the fact I'm italian). On the technical side, I'm mainly a coder, and Python is my favourite language. If you want, you can follow me on:

Hi, I'm **Luca Quartero**. I'm working with Flavio and make art assets. I was born in Biella (Piemonte), where I still live. After I discovered Blender, I fallen in love with this program, which offers a lot of tools for 3D graphics, animations and more. I like all kind of games in the videogames world: the most important thing is quality. Lately I'm a passionate of survival games and MMOs. I love thriller movies, but I also like good comedies. I'm not really good at cooking. I play the guitar and I like working wood. I practiced a lot of sports: soccer, swimming, tennis and karate. Lately I practice freeride, but after some falls I parked the bike and drive the mouse now.

My name is **Jay** and I am from Phoenix, Arizona. I currently live in the south of Puerto Rico. In my free time, I love to play classic video games and compose music for fun. I started playing piano at age 14 and decided soon after that music is my hobby and my passion.

Hi everybody, I am <strong>Dario Murgia</strong>, recently I joined the Ya2 team as beta-tester.
I was born in Albano, a nice town nearby Rome, and now I'm living in Nijmegen, a nice city in the Netherlands close to the border with Germany.
I have a MSc in Electronics Engineering and I'm working with smart audio amplifiers for smartphones and tablets as Application Engineer.
I love music, especially rock and electronic ones, from time to time I go to concerts and big festivals. I play drums, I like to play futsal and fish in lakes or rivers (catch and release only!)
Open source and sharing knowledge is my religion, I like to understand how things are made and how they work.
