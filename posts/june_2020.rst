Hi! Here is an update about my development progresses, as of June 2020.

Yorg updates
------------

I am continuing my work on Yorg. I have received a request for adding the support for **Snap** packages, so I added it. Anyway, I have not tested it deeply yet.

I am contintuing the refactoring. The goal is to remove the macroscopic code smells, so I can freeze the code for the next release.

Next project updates
--------------------

I have modeled other objects. Here is one of them: the second car. Its name is *Python*. Here is a screenshot and a real-time rendering.
