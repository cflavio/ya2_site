Yorg updates
------------

Just a fast update about Yorg. I have completed the development of the new features of the next release. We are doing several internal tests now: I am receiving many suggestions from Leandro, who is helping a lot for the new release. When the internal tests will be ok, the new release candidate will be ready.

Next project updates
--------------------

I have completed the models of the cars. Obviously, I am going to iteratively improve them in the future. Anyway, they are "ready" (imho) for a first prototype of the game. The next step is modeling the first track. Here are a screenshot of a new car and a real-time rendering.
